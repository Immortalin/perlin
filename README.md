The latest release supports dynamic creation of note objects. Currently, the note objects that Perlin offers are as follows:

Planned amendments
-----
**GUI:**
* Nightmode (alternate color constants)
* Notifications 

**Functionality:**
* Record date/time/frequency of opening a note
* Order by most/least viewed
* Order by last opened
* Create pages in full from txt files:

    Using a stream-lined syntax, loading a page of notes from a txt file (with the user selecting a style) is high priority.
    Also, being able to load notes and predictively formatting headers and such, is of priority.

* Option to show 'All Notes' from all notebooks.

**Note-Objects:**
* List object
* Spider diagram
* Box plot
* Graph
* Trigonometric graphs (pre-defined)
