### Note-Organiser

I intend to create a sort of organiser for the desktop.
Mainly focused towards students to create and share notes, and a way to represent a timeline of
information that has been accumulated in the course.

Run the .EXE file in a folder with the /data/ directory to see the current progress.

Currently I am the only person actively working on the project, if you are interested in
helping or just to ask a few questions I would be elated to hear from you.

I am best to contact through e-mail: ldhmachin@gmail.com
